thursday , april 17 , 1986
the house met at 11 a.m.
canadian charter of rights and freedoms
we took the initiative in assessing and amending current legislation and policies to ensure that they reflect a broad interpretation of the charter .
in doing so , we have tried to rise above the conventional political options and take a new and broader view .
for example , last december new initiatives and increased funding was announced to improve the status of disabled persons .
there is no doubt that the charter is affecting all of our lives .
the charter is giving individuals a new opportunity to seek redress when their rights are infringed upon .
it also imposes on all an obligation to be tolerant of the rights of others .
i hope that all hon . members will continue to work towards achieving this collective goal .
it is also the first anniversary of the charter being brought into force .
we have also shown we are prepared to carry out those rights within our own homeland .
we do not , as some countries do , merely talk .
that is to our glory .
we can be very proud and i want to join with all members of this house in proclaiming this happy occasion .
certainly everyone in my caucus is concerned about human rights .
however , we have a ways to go .
however , it is not enough to merely have guidelines and to speak in generalities .
we must also have teeth in our law .
certainly all of us in this house are very proud of the proclamation of the charter of rights .
one year ago today we proclaimed the final section of the charter of rights , section 15 .
one year later we must examine with care the record of the government .
we celebrate today the accomplishments of those canadians who fought so hard for a strong , entrenched charter of rights .
they criticize the paternalistic approach taken by the government .
equality must be a reality .
presentation of report of delegation to yugoslavia
they want to bring to an end all weapons testing in the test range and convert the test range to peaceful purposes .
mr. speaker : shall the hon . member have leave to introduce the bill ?
some hon . members : agreed .
mr. speaker : order .
the hon . member knows that summaries of private member 's bills are intended to be as brief as possible .
motion agreed to , bill read the first time and ordered to be printed .
order paper questions    questions on the order paper
( questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk . )
employment & immigration information system
mr. lewis : i ask , mr. speaker , that the remaining questions be allowed to stand .
mr. speaker : the question enumerated by the hon . parliamentary secretary has been answered .
shall the remaining questions stand ?
some hon . members : agreed .
those are clear instructions .
but what if the employer does not do those things ?
there is no follow up action whatsoever .
it is the same with this bill .
there was a demostration of disabled persons on the hill a few days ago .
they clearly pointed out that they are not hoodwinked by the bill .
we can not masquerade this shell of a bill as a bill which is taking a step towards providing some equality in the workplace .
that is why my colleague put forward his amendment .
the only penalty in the bill is in clause 6 .
that is with respect to how many employees and so on .
the penalty for not filing that report is $ 500,000 .
it seems to me that that is not where we have to put the penalty .
the penalty ought to be where employers are required to do certain things to actually bring about equality in the workplace .
very conveniently , the government excludes the federal civil service from the provisions of the bill .
so the government itself is not even prepared to accept the bill as applying to itself as an employer .
we would urge the government to accept the subamendment of my colleague , the hon . member for ottawa centre .
i believe it would show the good faith of the government .
it would show that it really wants to do something about equality in the workplace .
it would certainly send a message to the employers that the government is serious about creating equity in the workplace .
i would not mind if the government wanted to take the $ 500,000 penalty out of clause 6 .
i would not personally be opposed to that .
what is the big fuss about not filing a report ?
that information can be found out .
after all , the employer has to file an income tax return .
it seems to me that this is not where we ought to place the emphasis .
clauses 4 and 5 are the clauses which require employers to do specific things with respect to equity .
those are the particular clauses which need the teeth and not clause 6 .
this bill was introduced in the house for first reading in june of 1985 .
that is almost one year ago .
there was debate on the bill at that time .
there was debate on the bill at second reading stage .
there was debate on the bill in committee .
here we are now back with it in the house of commons .
so it has had a great deal of debate .
i know that the hon . member has been a party to that debate .
i know that he realizes in his heart of hearts that there is an enforcement mechanism in the bill .
in fact , in part of his remarks he referred to the fact that there is such a mechanism .
quite clearly , as hon . members are aware , the bill provides that there must first be a plan .
mr. rodriguez : where is the enforcement ?
mr. redway : it provides that there must be a plan .
of course , that is set out in clause 5 .
under the provisions of that clause a minister can issue regulations as to the guidelines for the plan .
mr. rodriguez : what if they do n't ?
the subject matter of the plan has to be filed with the minister and filed in the house .
first , there is a clause for requiring compliance with the plan , as the hon . member well knows .
mr. rodriguez : i rise on a point of order , mr. speaker .
in fact , there is no penalty for not filing the plan .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : i regret to interrupt the hon . member .
that is not a point of order , it is a point of debate .
the hon . member for york east ( mr. redway ) has the floor .
clause 6 of the bill requires the filing of the report and clause 7 imposes a penalty for not filing it .
quite clearly , the hon . member , and all hon . members in the opposition , know this .
they know it in their heart of hearts .
it is the first time that federal legislation of this sort has come forward .
perhaps hon . members want to go one step further .
in fact , it was not designated as a target group until our government came to office in 1985 .
ms. copps : i rise on a point of order , mr. speaker .
we love to hear the hon . member for york east ( mr. redway ) speak .
but , for heaven 's sake , when he speaks he should speak the truth .
that is an absolute falsehood and he knows it .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : that is debate .
it is not a point of order .
if the hon . member wishes to participate in debate she will have an opportunity .
the hon . member for york east .
mr. redway : i certainly hope the hon . member will repeat that outside the house , mr. speaker .
ms. copps : with pleasure .
sue me and i will see you in court .
ms. copps : i rise on a point of order , mr. speaker .
i am surprised that we do not have compassion in the house .
the hon . member for york east has the floor .
if the hon . member for hamilton east ( ms. copps ) wishes to participate in the debate then she will have that opportunity .
mr. waddell : we have now had the benediction , let 's have the speech !
mr. redway : as i have indicated , there is an enforcement mechanism in the legislation .
it is the intention to ensure that there is employment equity for those four target groups .
however , it is not the intention of the government to try to enforce this provision by putting people in jail .
it is the intention of the government to bring that enforcement about in an orderly and logical fashion .
that is what this legislation is geared at .
there are many examples in the united states of legislation of this sort .
time and time again it has been proved that that does not work .
at that time , the administration had been called on the carpet because the system which it had put in place did not work .
the system being put in place by this bill will work .
if it does not work there will be other steps and other measures to come in the future .
the system which has been put in place by this bill is the first step .
it is the first step which has been taken by any canadian government .
it will be an effective first step .
employers are already hurrying to ensure that they are in line by the time this piece of legislation passes into law .
i am sure the government will be doing just that .
it is about time we put it into law .
i might say that he has blatantly misled the house and the canadian people on several points .
mr. redway : mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order .
i think that is an unparliamentary remark and should be withdrawn .
mr. orlikow : mr. speaker , i rise on the same point of order .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : just a moment .
does the hon . member for winnipeg north ( mr. orlikow ) have something to contribute to this ?
mr. orlikow : a point of order , yes .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : before i entertain a point of order , could i see the table officers ?
i do not think he really meant what he said .
i would hope that he would withdraw at least that portion of the statement and carry on with debate .
however , it is my strong conviction that the hon . member has misled the house in the remarks he just made .
i think that is parliamentary .
i would hope that we could carry on with fellowship and compassion .
does the hon . member have another point of order ?
mr. redway : mr. speaker , he repeated again a statement which i believe is unparliamentary and should be withdrawn .
if it is your ruling , mr. speaker , that it was not--
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : order , please .
i will hear the hon . member .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : would the hon . member mind resuming his seat ?
that is why i asked the hon . member to withdraw .
he has done so and , therefore , i think he should carry on with debate .
as i said earlier , clause 2 of the bill indicates that the purpose of this bill is to achieve equality in the workplace .
that is great rhetoric of which we all approve .
that is fine too .
clause 5 says that employers have to prepare an action plan setting out goals and timetables .
clause 6 simply requires the employer to file information regarding the composition of his workforce .
the clause would then read that an employer who fails to comply with sections 4 , 5 and 6 is guilty of an offence .
right now the clause reads that the employer is guilty of an offence only if he does not comply with section 6 .
i am convinced that he can not show me that .
not one of them would agree with him .
in addition , the hon . member has not even read the amendments we put forward .
that is a red herring that the hon . member has thrown on the floor before us .
mr. de corneille : smells like a tuna .
these people who were elected in 1984 do not know what happened before 1984 .
they are not familiar with what took place .
they are reading the press releases put out by the minister , but they are not telling the truth , and everyone knows it .
every group representing these people has registered very strong objections to the bill and has said that it will not do the job .
what does the bill indicate ?
it has already been pointed out that there is no penalty if an employer does not file a plan .
however , i have a much more serious objection .
what about employers who file plans which do not do what the bill wants them to do ?
there is no penalty for that .
the hon . member is wrong .
he either does not know the facts , or he does not want us to know the facts .
he is just wrong .
people in the united states have not been put in jail , but the american law requires employers to perform .
the american law calls upon employers to have objectives , not just theoretical objectives .
it calls upon them to have numerical goals and to report on how they meet them .
it has worked in the united states and the national association of manufacturers has said that it likes it .
because of their ideological approach to things , some of president reagan 's advisors want to get rid of the numerical goals .
canadians know secretary of labour bill brock because he was trade negotiator for a while .
he is urging the president and the administration to keep the numerical goals .
why will they not accept the arguments of the organizations representing the very people the bill is supposed to help ?
i just use that as an example .
our record in providing employment for members of minority groups is not a good one .
we have a long way to go and a lot for which we should be apologetic .
however , there are some philosophical differences and techniques .
some very useful discussion has taken place over the last eight or nine months , but that is what it is all about .
that is what the democratic process is all about .
that is what the house of commons is for .
we can not agree on exactly how it will be put into effect , but we all want the same results .
in this particular motion we are being asked for prescribed goals and timetables .
we had a feeling that that would mean more quotas , a new enforcement agency and more regulatory bodies .
those are the things we wanted to avoid .
i should like to clarify the following because it may need some clarification .
mr. fairweather stated that reports submitted under section 5 would give enough evidence of systemic discrimination .
it is exactly what the commission wanted , and how it will deal with data was included in its testimony .
if results are bad , the canadian human rights commission can conduct an investigation , including access to the action plans .
motion no . 32a would have the fine increased from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 .
we feel that $ 50,000 is realistic .
it is in accordance with other legislation , such as the canadian human rights act .
for these reasons i am opposed to the two motions now being discussed .
mrs. lucie pépin ( outremont ) : mr. speaker , i rise in support of the amendment .
the human rights commission is also being asked to act as guard dog to point out irregularities .
we have the impression that this bill will be another smokescreen as often happens with the bills aimed at women which this government introduces .
we all know that , without penalties , it is impossible to have an acceptable piece of legislation .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : is the house ready for the question ?
some hon . members : question .
the first question is on the amendment .
mr. cassidy , moved :
that motion no . 31a be amended as follows by deleting the following words :
the question is on the amendment .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the amendment .
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour of the amendment please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed subamendment stands deferred .
at the same time i must put motion 32a.
mr. de corneille : mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order .
i believe the amendment to motions nos . 31a and 32a have been debated but not the motions themselves .
the amendment to those motions has not been completed .
i would like to speak to this motion .
the grouping was motions nos . 31a and 32a and the amendment .
i do not think i can allow the hon . member to speak with regard to the main amendment .
the member should have known what was taking place .
i have to put the question on the main amendment .
mr. allmand : mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order .
we started the debate on that .
that subamendment has just been disposed of .
now we should be returning to the original debate on motions nos . 31a and 32a which were grouped for debate by the speaker .
the speaker did not predict that there would be a subamendment to those two original motions .
one could not address the original two motions while addressing the subamendment .
we had to dispose of the subamendment first before we addressed the principles embodied in the original amendment .
mr. gauthier : there is one question before the house .
motions nos . 31a and 32a were grouped along with the amendment .
the vote was to take place .
it is my understanding that there has been consultation with the table .
the speaker has ruled on this previously .
i did not speak on the subamendment .
i do not want to disagree with the speaker , but perhaps he would like to hold that in abeyance and think about it .
mr. gauthier : yes .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : i will allow it .
in his motion the member suggests that the penalty should be increased from $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 .
martin luther king said that legislation , the law is a teacher .
in other words , as well as punishing people , it teaches .
we in this house must not think that companies should escape with impunity when they violate human rights .
it is good business to have people of all sexes , colours , and creeds portrayed in advertising .
enlightened people know that that is good business .
however , some people are not enlightened .
they hoped for this because other companies were not complying and were able to escape with impunity for noncompliance with those rules .
the enlightened people in the country thought it was good to have legislation which imposed penalties , and also that it was a teacher .
we should think not only of human rights , but also of human responsibilities .
through this legislation we are trying to make the employer responsible .
it is important that this bill makes employers understand their responsibility and that society will not tolerate such a lack of responsibility .
companies must conform to human rights .
ultimately , it is wrong from every point of view .
therefore , we must not allow companies and organizations to defy the values for which the people of this country stand .
today is the fourth anniversary of the signing and bringing into effect of the charter of rights and freedoms .
the secretay of state ( mr. bouchard ) is throwing a beautiful party for a thousand people to celebrate this occasion .
it is silly to pretend that this bill has any compliance requirements or penalties at all .
the rest of the bill asks people to do certain things , but there is no punishment or censure for noncompliance .
if the abella commission had reported otherwise , mr. speaker , i would have no leg to stand on .
if the affected groups were not outraged and disappointed , i would have no leg to stand on .
let this not be a paper tiger .
let it not be said that something was done for the minorities .
we do not want people to think that politicians talk through their hats , pretending to mean something when they do not .
we do not want people to be further disillusioned with politics in a democratic system .
let their voices be heard .
all these things are at stake .
finally , and above all , what is at stake is justice for those people who have waited long enough .
those people are looking for justice now .
it is not fair for them to have to wait with eternal optimism , as does the member of parliament on the other side .
that is not good enough .
this is the day we celebrate the charter being in effect for a year .
it was passed four years ago .
this is from the canadian charter of rights and freedoms .
--shall not have effect until three years after this section comes into force .
it would certainly be cheaper .
the same thing applies to the handicapped .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : is the house ready for the question ?
some hon . members : question .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the question is on motion no . 31a. mr. allmand moves :
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 7 by striking out lines 13 and 14 at page 4 and substituting the following therefor :
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
the question is on motion no . 32a. mr. allmand moves :
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 7 by striking out line 16 at page 4 and substituting the following therefor :
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motions ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
hon . members will know that motions nos . 34 and 35 have been grouped for debate and will be voted on separately .
mr. ian deans ( hamilton mountain , for mr. nystrom ) moves :
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 9 by striking out line 23 at page 4 and substituting the following therefor :
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 10 by striking out lines 29 and 30 at page 4 and substituting the following therefor :
as presently written , the bill would provide only that there be consultation and analysis of the snapshot of the character of the workforce .
it is a reasonable amendment and would provide for a report not only on the snapshot but on the employer 's efforts at change .
that is an obvious need and these are amendments which should certainly be concurred in by the government .
we think this amendment is a good one .
mr. gerry weiner ( parliamentary secretary to minister of employment and immigration ) : mr. speaker , we disagree .
employers action plans are not included in the reporting requirements of the bill .
therefore this motion can not be enforced .
the same rationale applies to motion no . 35 , so we would be opposed to both .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : is the house ready for the question ?
some hon . members : question .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the question is on motion no . 34 , in the name of mr. nystrom .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
the next question is on motion no . 35 , in the name of mr. nystrom .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
the next motion for debate is no . 37a.
in english it says they shall submit a report on the review to parliament including a statement of any changes the committee would recommend .
however , in french it leaves part of that out by simply saying :
--présente au parlement un rapport exposant tous les changements qu'il peut désirer recommander .
some hon . members : agreed .
mr. gerry weiner ( parliamentary secretary to minister of employment and immigration ) : mr. speaker , we agree .
some hon . members : hear , hear !
mr. dick : great speech .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : is the house ready for the question ?
some hon . members : question .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the question is on motion no . 37a in the name of mr. allmand .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
motion no . 37a ( mr. allmand ) agreed to .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the next motion for debate is motion no . 39 .
mr. ian deans ( hamilton mountain , for mr. nystrom ) moves :
that bill c-62 , be amended by deleting the short title and substituting the following therefor :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski):is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
the next question is on motion no . 39a.
that bill c-62 , be amended by deleting the short title and substituting the following therefor :
if the bill is not really going to enforce employment equity but simply require reporting , then let us call it what it is .
that is the purpose of this amendment and the previous one .
they are to make the bill an honest bill and not mislead the public .
it has absolutely no provision for penalties for companies who do not comply .
as far as i am concerned even the targets are secret to the companies .
i would hope that the house would see fit to change the name of the bill to reflect what it really is .
it is not a bill which achieves , or even aims at achieving employment equity .
i am sure the hon . parliamentary secretary will show good sense with respect to this amendment regarding the title of the bill .
mr. weiner : no , mr. speaker , the act is appropriately named .
mr. fennell : the liberals never brought in anything .
ms. copps : the hon . members says the liberals never brought in anything .
it was the first party to introduce in 1977 equal pay for work of equal value .
the hon . member should get to know his facts .
that is exactly what they mean .
i think it is a crying shame that on equality day we are talking about a bill which is absolute nonsense .
this is the last motion and , appropriately , it is last because the question is about the title of the bill .
there are many native people and minority groups all waiting for legislation which would give them strengthened support , to at last have equality .
unfortunately we have received no support from the government for any of these motions .
therefore , obviously , this remains a reporting bill , not a bill which achieves anything other than verbiage .
it is not an act which brings about equity .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : is the house ready for the question ?
some hon . members : question .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the question is on motion no . 39 .
mr. deans : i rise on a point of order , mr. speaker .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : thank you .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
some hon . members : no .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those in favour please say yea .
some hon . members : yea .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : all those opposed please say nay .
some hon . members : nay .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : in my opinion the nays have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : pursuant to standing order 114(11 ) , the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred .
the house will now proceed with the recorded divisions deferred at the report stage of bill c-62 , an act respecting employment equity .
call in the members .
and the division bells having rung :   mr. speaker : order , please .
the first question is on motion no . 1 .
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 2 by striking out line 6 at page 1 and substituting the following therefor :
the house divided on the motion ( mr. nystrom ) , which was negatived on the following division :
39   mr. speaker : i declare the motion lost .
i take it there is an agreement .
mr. deans : mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order .
there are two brief matters which i want to raise .
it is my understanding that we might agree to have the vote we have just taken count for all the outstanding votes .
however , it has been brought to my attention that on motion no . 31a the yeas and nays were not taken .
if we could include that , then all the votes would be concluded .
mr. speaker : order , please .
mr. gray ( windsor west ) : mr. speaker , i was unable to be present for the vote just taken .
mr. speaker : yes .
mr. allmand : mr. speaker , i think you failed to mention motions nos . 39 and 39a.
mr. speaker : order , please .
i am trying to do it in some order .
on the motions so far called there is an understanding , with the addition of the hon . member for windsor west .
mr. gagnon : would you recognize my vote , please , mr. speaker ?
the next vote will be on motion no . 8 .
that bill c-62 , be amended in clause 3 by striking out lines 13 to 15 at page 2 .
the house divided on motion no . 8 ( mr. nystrom ) , which was negatived on the following division :

the house resumed at 2 p.m.
statements pursuant to s.o. 21
we note that corporations have been the most successful users of the charter in their own interests .
they have the money to take the government to court in lengthy , costly court challenges .
while business can deduct the costs , individuals can not .
there are 55 cases waiting for financial help to start the process toward justice .
the federal government has set up a fund to help alleviate financial hardship for selected court challenges i ask--
mr. speaker : order , please .
the u.s. has now admitted that the information was false .
leonard peltier is an ojibway lakota indian who sought political asylum in canada .
for 10 years he has been held in u.s. prisons serving two consecutive life sentences for crimes it now appears he did not commit .
the least we can do as a house of commons is call for a new and fair trial .
as a nation we should also call for the return of leonard peltier .
mr. speaker : order , please .
this legislation has become even more relevant with revelations with week of more evidence about the functioning of therapeutic abortion committees .
this issue is a difficult one for many canadians .
there are millions who occupy one side of the debate or the other .
it is for precisely this reason that it must be addressed .
the abortion approval process is a matter that requires clarification .
mothers , doctors , and child protection agencies must know the requirements of canada 's criminal code on this issue .
it is clear that practices have developed which are well outside the spirit of the criminal code .
many doctors may be unwittingly breaching the criminal code and are parties to criminal offences .
city of vancouver 's resolution
the outlook for canada 's shipbuilding and allied industries during 1986 will remain dismal without immmediate government policy action .
the city of vancouver has passed a resolution which reads as follows :
whereas canada 's sovereignty over its arctic territories has been challenged ;
and whereas the west coast shipbuilding industry has developed a highly competitive ability to build such ships ;
and whereas the conservative government promised a meaningful job creation program in the west ;
and whereas the north vancouver shipbuilding industry now faces virtual extinction with disastrous economic consequence unless immediate action is taken--
mr. speaker : order , please .
effect of falling oil prices on small companies
for example , as many as 15,000 jobs on drilling rigs may be lost by the end of this year .
david hatter , a respected writer , said in the financial post :
i think a floor price is a better answer .
however , we have an open mind .
possible closure of stations in gaspé region
incidentally , 10,000 gaspé peninsula residents have signed a petition to express their deep concern and determination concerning that issue .
mr. speaker , i should hope that the notions of justice , logic and human dignity will prevail--
mr. speaker : order , please , the 60 seconds have expired .
mrs. mary collins ( capilano ) : mr. speaker , today , april 17 , is an important day for canadians .
this fourth annual law day is the biggest yet .
mock trials , court room tours , and media interviews give the public a unique opportunity to find out more about canadian law .
while we in this house bear the onerous responsibility of making the law , it is essential that canadians understand their laws .
mr. speaker : order , please .
decision by 7-eleven stores to stop selling pornographic magazines
hardcore , violent pornography is having a cancerous effect on morals and quality of life in canada .
erotica often leads to softcore pornography , which leads to hardcore , violent pornography .
access to child care services
since the middle of march , i have attended the hearings of the parliamentary committee on daycare .
i would like to call the attention of the house to the views of various witnesses .
many parents are asking that quality services be available and that they be organized by the government .
of course , we also hear about the great number of latchkey children .
this is certainly food for thought !
appeal for bequest of organs following deaths
we have to applaud all these people who are aware of the need for livers , kidneys , eyes and hearts .
we have to encourage those who work at promoting organ banks .
i take this opportunity to invite all canadian men and women to contribute generously by donating their organs when they die .
thousands of people wait for an organ to give them some hope to improve or prolong their life .
this is the most precious posthumous gift that a human being can give to someone who is still living .
the scientific obstacles have long disappeared , we now have the necessary knowledge in canada and the hospitals have the required facilities .
this is a priceless contribution .
non payment of income tax
eaton trust company made a profit of $ 709,980 and paid no income tax at all .
mr. speaker : order , please .
on a $ 50,000 mortgage , this represents a saving of $ 1,750 per year , or $ 34 per week .
we have managed to help the economy recover without increasing inflation .
with our government , canadians ' savings maintain their purchasing power , which was not the case under the liberals inflationary policies .
government actions on behalf of women
these measures and others are evidence of the government 's commitment to equality for canadian women .
what measures does the canadian government intend to take to provide for the immediate departure of these canadians ?
therefore my responses yesterday , which no doubt the hon . member has seen , have not altered .
we have the prime minister in the house so let me try him again .
we believed at that time that supporting the u.s. in a series of economic sanctions would be the best way to proceed .
it turned out that that did not find favour with a number of allies .
that step having failed , other steps were taken by the u.s. those have been discussed by myself and the deputy prime minister .
safety of canadian citizens in libya
we understand there are three hercules aircraft in lahr , germany , which could be used to evacuate canadians from libya .
that is simply not true .
the hon . gentleman , having been a member of a previous government , should know that .
the information we have from the globe and mail this morning says that canadians--
some hon . members : oh , oh !
mr. rompkey : you have to get your information from somewhere if you can not get it from the government .
our consul says they are becoming increasingly worried , and about a quarter of them want to get out--
mr. speaker : this is a supplementary question .
does the hon . member have a question , please ?
mr. rompkey : if those hercules are not going to be used in view of the situation , what are the government 's plans ?
can the government tell us what plans it has to evacuate canadians in this serious situation ?
second , the airport is now either open or in the process of being opened for commercial travel .
mr. johnston : they will go by wardair , i suppose .
mr. mulroney : the hon . gentleman from westmount on a serious matter talks about wardair .
i can tell him that we do not do this frivolously .
mr. allmand : you did n't show up for two days .
mr. mulroney : i can tell him that we have contingency plans which involve the government of canada--
mr. gauthier : tell us about it .
mr. mulroney : --to protect the security of canadians , as opposed to these frivolous acts by the opposition .
some hon . members : hear , hear !
mr. speaker : order .
it is exactly as my hon . friend has reported it to be .
however , we have no information that would cause us the kind of concern to which he refers .
in fact the level of anxiety and concern among canadian residents presently in libya has declined substantially .
they want to leave libya but they can not obtain either an exit visa or a means of leaving the country .
today is equality day and seven months have passed since the court challenges program came into effect to enforce section 15 of the charter .
about twenty cases are being examined at this time .
i think that the fact we are taking the time to do so guarantees the high standard of the decisions that will be made .
that is the short answer to the question .
hon . benoît bouchard ( secretary of state of canada ) : mr. speaker , i think i did answer the previous question .
we are establishing procedures in areas where human rights are concerned , where every necessary precaution must be taken .
once again , we believe that the procedures we have today are the right ones .
we are working on very basic and fundamental matters , where our initial decisions will affect all subsequent decisions .
i do n't think we can be accused of--
mr. speaker : order , please .
the hon . member for vancouver east ( ms. mitchell ) .
ms. margaret mitchell ( vancouver east ) : mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of national health and welfare .
today we celebrate the anniversary of the charter of rights .
ms. margaret mitchell ( vancouver east ) : mr. speaker , i think the minister will recall that the prime minister also promised funding .
she knows that there have to be additions , changes , and improvements to day care .
we all recognize that .
week after week the task force has been asking for people 's views .
will the prime minister tell the house specifically when and from whom he first learned of the american plans to attack libya ?
some hon . members : oh , oh !
we put forward views , particularly dealing with the safety and security of canadian nationals in libya , all of whom are still there .
it would be singularly unhelpful to them to reveal any details in regard to that .
timing of receipt of information
i asked him when he was informed , and he did not answer that question .
i asked him by whom he was informed , and he did not answer that question .
because i do not think that these are the type of questions he can avoid answering i will ask them again .
specifically , what kind of advice did he give to the individual who told him ?
he asked two questions and i have no intention of answering either because they could affect the security and safety of canadians in libya .
that is an irresponsible suggestion the hon . member made .
some hon . members : hear , hear !
membership of court challenges panel
is the minister in fact attempting to exert a degree of political interference in what should be an arm 's length process ?
mrs. lucie pépin ( outremont ) : mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of national health and welfare .
it is for that reason that i look forward to its recommendations .
we are looking at how best to do it .
mr. speaker : order .
how does the federal government intend to compensate quebec for this loss of $ 66 million in equalization payments ?
why did the federal government forget its promise to meet this commitment to quebec ?
right hon . brian mulroney ( prime minister ) : mr. speaker , what the hon . member is saying is utter nonsense .
it was our government that gave more than $ 100 million to quebec , manitoba and nova scotia , and so forth .
head office control over news stories
mr. john a. macdougall ( timiskaming ) : mr. speaker , my question is for the minister of communications .
i simply will not .
some hon . members : hear , hear !
some hon . members : oh , oh !
mr. speaker : order , please .
just a short question , please .
will the prime minister explain to the house exactly what the preconditions are that are being sought by the american administration ?
i think i have made that very clear .
some hon . members : oh , oh !
some hon . members : oh , oh !
mr. mulroney : why is he always absent when we are discussing important matters ?
some hon . members : hear , hear !
some hon . members : oh , oh !
mr. speaker : order , please .
in a news release on february 27 the minister stated that :
the moratorium on fcc foreclosures will be lifted only when the commodity based loans and rural transition programs are up and running .
with no programs yet in place , will the minister state more precisely the conditions under which he will now lift the moratorium ?
will it now be after harvest ?
proposed commodity based mortgage program
the people in fcc offices do n't know the details .
they ca n't assess whether a farmer is even eligible .
mr. speaker : order , please .
mr. althouse : if they announce it in june , what happens ?
mr. rob nicholson ( niagara falls ) : mr. speaker , my question is for the parliamentary secretary to the minister of the environment .
the niagara river is the source of drinking water for millions of canadians and its pollution is everyone 's concern .
we have been engaged in long and difficult negotiations since october , 1985 .
while they have been long and difficult , progress has been made .
we hope to be able to report a conclusion agreeable to all parties within the next several weeks .
date of decision to apply regulation with regard to early retirees
it was given a year 's lead time before implementation .
it came into effect in january of this year .
inquiry how minister can pretend to have informed beneficiaries in advance
what was taking place was conveyed to members of the house of commons .
letters were sent to all major employers across the country by the unemployment insurance commission .
people have been notified in company after company .
members have been notified .
i will continue to ensure that members are notified as they ask additional questions .
right hon . brian mulroney ( prime minister ) : mr. speaker , the word ambush suggests some great untoward set of circumstances .
in my statement in the house of commons on september 26 i said :
success is not a sure thing--
some hon . members : hear , hear !
we could take the prime minister back to his words before he was elected , at which point he opposed free trade .
some hon . members : oh , oh !
he has led us down a blind path .
mr. fulton : they do n't even know your name down there , muldoon .
mr. mulroney : --could result in new jobs , new wealth , and new prosperity for canada .
that is what we offered , as opposed to the old status quo--
mr. waddell : play it again , muldoon .
some hon . members : hear , hear !
can he further confirm the report that tonnes of unfit pork and chicken were improperly approved for market ?
hon . john wise ( minister of agriculture ) : no , mr. speaker , i can not confirm that at the moment .
that information was brought to my attention early this morning .
the member may take some satisfaction , as i did , from the fact that an investigation had already commenced before i called .
some hon . members : oh , oh !
i do not know why the member is so nervous , because i have every confidence in the meat inspection system of the country .
mr. albert girard ( restigouche ) : mr. speaker , my question is directed to the minister of regional industrial expansion .
i am also aware of the great success the minister has been having in cape breton .
will the minister now instruct his department to make the same kind of concentrated effort to help restigouche overcome its high unemployment ?
hon . sinclair stevens ( minister of regional industrial expansion ) : mr. speaker , algoma steel has been in touch with my department .
i assure the hon . member that the matter is in hand as far as the government of canada is concerned .
mr. john r. rodriguez ( nickel belt ) : mr. speaker , my supplementary question is directed to the minister of state for finance .
one is the tax fairness which we brought to the corporation tax system .
the other is employment opportunities throughout canada , and particularly in areas like northern ontario .
we have always worked with companies--
mr. rodriguez : that 's not an answer to the question .
mrs. mcdougall : --including companies like algoma , to try to provide them with investment opportunities which create jobs .
ms. sheila copps ( hamilton east ) : mr. speaker , my question is directed to the prime minister .
we have already begun an examination and we will have comments to make about this later on .
role of minister of justice
ms. sheila copps ( hamilton east ) : mr. speaker , the minister responsible says that an examination has begun .
ms. copps : why has nothing been done ?
mr. crosbie : i do not know how the hon . member got on this list as well .
we are checking this with canada post .
effect of falling oil prices on small companies
is she prepared to consider helping small canadian oil companies in alberta in order to do something to help that economy ?
we are looking at all options which will provide some relief to an area of the country which is being badly devastated .
mr. waddell : i hope she will treat the matter with some urgency .
is the minister aware of that problem ?
is she prepared to protect small canadian oil companies from being gobbled up by the big american companies ?
which of these positions is the government 's position ?
that of the person responsible for the linguistic policy , or that of a reluctant conservative government ?
i think there are very basic considerations in this issue .
the federal system itself is very complex .
i think that my colleague ...
tomorrow , we will start consideration of the report stage of bill c-87 , an act to authorize the divestiture of canadian aresenals limited .
subsequently , we will continue consideration of bill c-45 .
monday , we will start the third reading of bill c-62 , an act respecting employment equity .
once that has been completed , we will get back to bil c-45 .
mr. speaker , i will monitor the situation very closely and make additional announcements if necessary .
in any event it would be a direction to the table .
the clerk would receive and accept that petition by direct delivery , or with an accompanying letter .
that would be the extent of it .
there would be no requirement for a response because of the fact it does not comply with the new standing orders .
it would not be delivered or presented in the house , but it would be done directly with the clerk of the house .
mr. speaker : order , please .
i do not think the chair requires that there be a motion to that effect .
we will look at what the hon . president of the privy council ( mr. hnatyshyn ) has said .
we may have to come back and ask for a house order .
if so , i take it there is a willingness to do so .
is it the understanding at that time then that members of the opposition would have an equal opportunity to respond to her statement ?
mr. hnatyshyn : the hon . member did anticipate the next point that i was going to raise .
i have a draft order which has been the subject of discussion and i have presented this order to the opposition parties .
i think you would find a disposition to have this order received with unanimous consent and passed without debate .
the order is as follows :
it will not be a long statement , but we will continue with the adjournment motions immediately following the extended time period today .
mr. speaker : order , please .
can we procedurally deal with the question ?
does the president of the privy council ( mr. hnatyshyn ) have the unanimous consent necessary to introduce the motion ?
mr. hnatyshyn : the house leader for the official opposition is asking a legitimate question .
mr. speaker : does the president of the privy council have the unanimous consent necessary for the introduction of his motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
mr. speaker : the house has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?
some hon . members : agreed .
mr. speaker : agreed and so ordered .
parliamentary employment and staff relatins act
parliamentary employment and staff relations act
mr. speaker : resuming debate with six minutes remaining .
he indicated , in other words , that we would be saving time by this particular measure .
prior to your leaving the chair perhaps i can just catch your attention for a minute .
i am sorry to say that to my friend , the speaker .
i want to say to you , sir , now that you have replaced the speaker , that i am very disturbed about this .
the house of commons should not be putting itself in this position .
that is a partisan position .
the mediator has made an attempt to get things going but nothing has happened .
the employees continue to be frustrated .
house of commons employees , for good and proper reasons , have been trying to get collective bargaining rights for 20 years .
the application before the canada labour board was november , 1983 , some two and a half years ago .
we do not know what is going to happen now .
the argument that the canada labour board should delay because the government was treating the matter as one of urgency is patently untrue .
it would have gone to committee , come back for third reading and been disposed of .
in fact , there is a measure in being .
they are certified as a union under the canada labour code .
therefore this house , which should be acting as a model for labour relations , is working in exactly the contrary direction .
the motion before us right now requests a delay in passage of this bill for a period of time .
i do not understand what is going on .
under the canada labour code they would have input and be able to negotiate regarding those issues .
under this bill they will not .
they fear , with reason , that this bill will prove to be even less effective than the public service staff relations act .
there is no staff relations board to which they can appeal on matters in dispute with their employer .
this bill could also be interpreted as a thinly disguised attempt at union bashing .
they will be asked to sign union cards again .
they are not guaranteed that the staff relations board will recognize the same bargaining units recognized by the canada labour board .
there are further opportunities for delay given to the employer if it decides to act as it has been acting .
that is a right for which working people have fought in every country .
it is traditionally one of the first rights to be taken away when dictators take away the rights of working people and attack democracy .
is the house of commons to be an accomplice in undermining the democratic rights of the 1,200 workers who have won certification ?
that would appear to be the case .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : i regret the hon . member 's time has expired .
mr. lewis : i do n't .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : questions or comments .
it was revealed in archives tapes that there were reports by a previous speaker of sexual harassment of staff on this hill .
women had to lay their bodies down to get and keep jobs here .
it seems to me that any kind of collective bargaining process must include mp 's staff and your honour 's staff .
i want to ask my colleague why he thinks the staff of members of the house of commons are not included in this bill .
mr. cassidy : mr. speaker , i can not answer that question .
as my hon . friend knows , we have in our caucus a staff association .
it seeks to act like a union but it is extremely difficult because it does not and can not get certification .
the extension of bargaining rights to members ' employees does not automatically mean there is going to be a strike in every conservative corridor .
it is up to the employees whether or not they want to exercise their rights , as it is in the private sector .
they know that if they go too far they will provoke the employees into exercising their rights .
competitions are not held for certain positions .
those positions are filled on a temporary basis .
these irregularities must end , but i am afraid that bill c-45 does not provide the assurance that those irregularities will end .
if my hon . friend has other questions i will be happy to answer them .
the hon . member has mentioned some examples of this .
would the hon . member tell us how collective bargaining rights might help in promoting greater equality on the hill ?
that is why people finally become so frustrated that they decide they want a union .
employers wonder why they all can not get along together .
i can give an example of sexual harrassment which was given to me by the union .
in a support service in the house of commons a female employee is the object of sexual harrassment .
her manager touches her , leans up behind her and rubs against her .
that is why we want effective collective bargaining rights for the workforce in the house of commons .
that is why we want the labour board certification proceeded with .
we certainly do not want a toothless bill such as represented by bill c-45 .
therefore , there can not be undertaken any risk that it might be stopped by a strike .
i would like my colleague to comment on that reasoning .
mr. rodriguez : that is assuming that parliament is an essential service .
mr. cassidy : my friend , the hon . member for nickel belt , says that is assuming that parliament is an essential service .
the workings of parliament are extremely important , if not essential .
i believe people would accept that .
but is it essential that parliamentarians be fed in the cafeterias on parliament hill ?
of course , it would .
we , of course , have the power to legislate were it to be ultimately required .
i would hope that that would never be needed .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : the time for questions and comments has now terminated .
i think we should ask ourselves why the motion was presented by my hon . colleague .
since then , not a word about the bill until the middle of april .
we can not proceed at a brisk pace because the question is too contentious , too important and in the final instance too perilous .
those were the words used by the secretary of state .
i for one would go along with the process of further consultation .
i consider the workers on the hill essential .
whether my friend , the hon . member for ottawa centre ( mr. cassidy ) , does or does not , i do .
i know him to be very respectful of picket lines .
we have to make up our minds in respect of this matter .
we can not have it both ways .
it is an essential service and it should be defined as such .
i would like to use that definition in my participation here , and i do not have it with me .
i see that a gentleman is bringing the book to me .
mr. epp ( provencher ) : an essential service .
mr. gauthier : yes , it is .
here is an example in vivo , as we say .
it is an essential service to the members of this house .
however , the legislation presented in the house does not live up to that billing .
it does not live up to my expectations of what should be forthcoming from the treasury board as the employer of public servants .
we did this because there are in the act matters which i find to be in great need of change .
there are matters such as classification standards to be considered .
during the election campaign the governing party promised that it would make classification standards negotiable .
that party has been in office for two years now and it has not even put forward a suggestion on the subject .
i admit it is a complex issue .
mr. gauthier : i believe that is an image which one can use to decide where one sits dans l'organigramme de l'organisation .
it hesitates on this matter as it does on many other matters .
it hesitates to come forward with some reasonable and meaningful modifications to its own public service staff relations act .
why are they not happy ?
i will explain why .
bill c-45 does not allow the employees of the house the right to strike .
it is a right which they would enjoy under the canada labour code .
this is the reason employees on the hill want to be covered under the canada labour code .
the unions on the hill have said that they will forgo their right to strike because they understand what are essential services .
god knows they are devoted and that they have been good to us .
that is the key to the whole issue .
i would add that they are not covered in the public service staff relations act either .
nabet and psac object , in particular , to clauses 5(3 ) and 55(2 ) .
clause 5(3 ) states :
i will now read into the record clause 55(2 ) since it is important .
why do we not place that on the table ?
that is what the government promised during the election campaign .
it is something with which i am in accord .
i do not think that members of the new democratic party would object to it .
why not give some of these matters serious thought ?
we are now into an era of compression of the human resources of the government of canada .
that is the essential truth .
he said that bill c-45 is landmark labour legislation which provides hill workers with important rights including health and safety rights .
to say that bill c-45 is landmark labour legislation is , i think , to misinform canadians and the ottawa community .
as a matter of fact , hill employees are covered by bill c-24 and we know that because we debated it .
the acting speaker ( mr. paproski ) : are questions or comments ?
if there are no questions or comments , is the house ready for the question ?
mr. orlikow : no .
nineteen years ago , stanley knowles spoke of the obligation of parliament to protect the rights of parliamentary employees .
he advocated collective bargaining rights for all employees .
according to a recent report done by mr. jeff parr who has studied this matter at some length , he has said the following :
this bill does not grant rights ; indeed it restricts them .
mr. parr 's report is entitled preserving the employee 's prerogative , and he also said the following :
but it has been much less successful in protecting employees of parliament hill from abuse by their employers .
some of those employers sit right here in parliament .
i would like to relate to the house my own personal feelings about this matter .
i came to this house as an elected member in 1979 .
i was concerned particularly about the working conditions of workers on the hill .
they are afraid of making complaints because they do not have any protection .
there are no grievance procedures .
the kind of lack of respect that appears so often in this patriarchal atmosphere would not be tolerated if staff members had a union .
it is undemocratic and it is offensive .
until recently , women and men were locked in traditional job ghettos on the hill .
women were the waitresses and men were the supervisors and members of the security staff with a higher rate of pay .
i congratulate the former speaker of the house , who is now the governor general , for the kinds of changes she made .
i am referring to changes which moved employees on the hill one step toward greater equality and equal opportunities .
as well , i wish our staff were much better paid .
this demonstrates that there has been some change , but the slowness of the change has been quite appalling .
also it demonstrates the need for collective bargaining rights for employees who work for parliament and for members of parliament .
it should be a right .
they should have a proper grievance procedure and all the conditions which go along with collective bargaining rights .
i should like to give two or three examples of the experiences documented by hill employees .
there is quite a long list , but i will mention the ones which pertain particularly to female employees .
they are some of the types of problems which reinforce the need for collective bargaining rights as a means to resolve workplace issues .
the administration of the library states than an administrative error was made .
this would not have been allowed to happen if those people had been in a union .
two petitions signed by 1,500 hill employees were ignored .
i should like to refer to another example in the support services .
a female employee is the object of sexual harassment .
her manager touches her , leans up behind her and rubs against her .
she is later given a poor performance evaluation and finally transferred to another position .
i am sure most employees who experience sexual harassment would be afraid to complain about it under the present situation .
it should not be tolerated either by workers or by all of us on the hill .
the only way to deal with it in a proessional and effective way is to have a union agreement and a proper grievance procedure .
i should like to refer to another example .
in the cafeteria services an employee cuts his hand on the job .
he is told to visit the nurse .
the nurse tells him that it is not safe to work and that he should go home .
the manager informs the employee that he should go back to work or face discipline .
what kind of work situation is that ?
this is the kind of condition which should not be left to chance or whim .
let us return to bill c-45 which is before us .
there are many problems with it , and that is why we do not support it .
we support negotiated collective bargaining rights for employees .
government members may not realize how ineffective bill c-45 is .
many important concerns are not open for negotiation .
they are not on the table at all .
i should like to refer to some examples of this .
bill c-45 prevents any real negotiation of the classification of positions and assignment of duties .
limits are set on what grievances can go to third party arbitration .
union grievances are not allowed .
what kind of collective bargaining are we talking about if union grievances are not allowed ?
the staff of members of parliament are excluded from the right to collective bargaining , a great omission .
also the right to strike is prohibited .
i heard my colleague speak about essential services .
this eliminates the kinds of negotiations and certifications under the canada labour code which have already gone forward .
we are very disappointed that they have not been implemented .
i should like to elaborate quickly and for the record on some of the negative points in the bill .
i understand that it is the source of a great deal of employee dissatisfaction .
many employees do not have job descriptions at all .
the result is that employees on the whole are frustrated and insecure , and there is a low level of morale .
improper classification can also result in significant financial losses for employees .
the lack of proper job descriptions hampers efficient operation of the workplace .
under the canada labour code , classification can be negotiated and has been successfully negotiated in many workplaces .
we should have the same situation on the hill .
there should be at least a minimum requirement for acceptable legislation , and it is not covered effectively by bill c-45 .
parliamentary employees want to have a say in establishing a fair and equitable staffing system based upon merit , length of experience and service .
if certified under the canada labour code , employees would have the right to negotiate both staffing and classification .
as it stands bill c-45 is inferior to the canada labour code and to the public service staff relations act .
bill c-45 does not allow workplace problems to be addressed by union grievances , grievances filed by a group of workers .
i remember several years ago hearing complaints about this .
here it is coming up again , particularly about air quality and other environmental problems in the wellington building .
these can not be subject to a union grievance .
what are workers supposed to do , mr. speaker ?
they have been putting up with bad air for years .
what use is the bill if that is the case ?
if an item can not be brought to third party adjudication , the employer is under no requirements to take it seriously .
for example , a poor performance appraisal , demotion or transfer can not go to adjudication .
a grievance can not go to adjudication .
again , it shows the weakness of this bill .
what about the right to strike ?
i know this is a very controversial issue in the minds of some members of parliament .
i know that parliamentary employees do not want to go on strike , few workers ever do .
