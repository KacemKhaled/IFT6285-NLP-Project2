please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
madam president , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka .
yes , mr evans , i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
if the house agrees , i shall do as mr evans has suggested .
madam president , on a point of order .
i would like your advice about rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
thank you , mr segni , i shall do so gladly .
indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted .
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest .
it is the case of alexander nikitin .
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
yes , mrs schroedter , i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter .
but , madam president , my personal request has not been met .
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .
it will , i hope , be examined in a positive light .
madam president , can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?
why has there been no fire drill , either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings ?
why are there no fire instructions ?
why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
mrs lynne , you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done .
i would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
mr berenguer fuster , we shall check all this .
i admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
so parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo .
as people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .
there is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what is happening .
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday .
no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .
( applause from the pse group )
mr bar처n crespo , you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday .
i am not criticising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
mr h채nsch represented you on this occasion .
your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members .
there was a vote on this matter .
as i recall , the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions .
all of the others were of a different opinion .
that was the decision .
i should now like to comment on the issue itself .
there is no such document !
the commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in february .
we have agreed to this .
you can not prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content .
the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group .
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .
( parliament rejected the request ) president .
still on the subject of wednesday ' s sitting , i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
thank you , mr poettering .
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request .
madam president , i would firstly like to point out mr poettering ' s lack of logic .
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups .
it is not a lot to ask .
( parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
madam president , i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate .
thank you very much .
madam president , has my vote been counted ? i was unable to vote electronically , since i do not have a card .
indeed , if we add the two members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
madam president , the presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
there is no room for amendments .
that did not happen .
this is an important matter .
you did not call me either .
i regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
i am terribly sorry , mr h채nsch and mr cox . i did not see you asking to speak .
even so , i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes .
this seems to me to be a workable solution .
of course , the minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
mr cox , mr h채nsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
madam president , if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not , and can not , object to that .
if your ruling is that i can not give an explanation of vote , i accept that but with reservations .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( the order of business was adopted thus amended )
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
our amendments from the first reading have , i believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
i would urge you to endorse this .
the renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of europe .
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit .
in fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
i congratulate him on his excellent report .
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
madam president , i would like to make a few comments .
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
this is a pity , in a sense .
or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
in short , the issue is an important one .
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these can not afford safety advisors .
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .
i would like to mention one final point .
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
madam president , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so .
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
this , however , does not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
i should like to make just a few comments .
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
i can live with these minimum standards , but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
my third point has also been mentioned already .
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
finally , i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission .
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , mr koch .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
transport of dangerous goods by road
delays in the cen ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , annexes can not be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
in this respect , i accept this proposal to amend directive 94/55/ec which has been tabled for discussion today .
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the member states obtain more powers .
the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own .
in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 1999 .
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
this is in the special interest of northern european regions .
i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but i would ask you to endorse this report .
mr president , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
i would like to briefly comment on the commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
consequently , i have tabled some amendments to mr koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
there is support for the eu in lapland also , so let us remember them .
i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40쨘c.
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .
i thought that it was quite superb .
this directive is a contribution to this .
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .
mr president , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu , both on roads and railways and by sea .
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .
in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states .
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
in many ways , the prerequisites differ from one member state to another .
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment .
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
a major part of wales , as you know , has been granted objective 1 status under the structural funds programme .
we have seen poverty growing in wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .
it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces .
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures .
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
finally , we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent .
this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales .
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
in the past , this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
these amendments also fit in with this parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .
in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund .
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively .
the consequences do not inspire hope .
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union .
agriculture only provides 5.5 % of employment in the union .
mr president , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , mr evans , of why wales actually achieved objective 1 status .
it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party .
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 1 additionality .
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation .
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes .
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
we are badly behind now in this matter .
for the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .
projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .
projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the union ' s regional policy in general .
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
this report is very good and our group supports it .
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
this fact means that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically .
i do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for .
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas .
this latter point is of particular importance .
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone .
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
unfortunately , this did not happen . mr berni챕 is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament ' s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .
personally , i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
as an islander , however , i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
mr president , commissioner , in this minute and a half i should like , first of all , to congratulate mrs schroedter .
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us .
finally , in this time of natural disasters , i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds .
as you know , it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
mr president , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
well , the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds .
the commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it .
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
there are , therefore , two points to which i would like to draw the commission ' s attention .
i would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .
i urge the house to support these changes .
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
mr president , mrs schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and i would like to congratulate her on that .
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states .
the union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the union ' s fundamental objectives .
mr president , commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
they are growing , but only in terms of gdp .
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels .
this is the purpose of these guidelines .
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
this is a situation which is , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date .
drawing to a close , i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , mrs schroedter .
i am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .
i actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .
i find the opposite the case .
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union
the european commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .
the sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union ' s regional policy aims .
the report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe .
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility .
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development .
our group is in favour of adopting this report .
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities .
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union .
by stimulating a diversity of investments , the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment .
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for .
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions .
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
finally , i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries .
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind eu countries , especially in terms of gdp per capita .
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards eu credibility .
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided , i would say quite magnificently , the development of poor countries .
the eu really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
what is the result ?
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust .
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
we must give them this opportunity .
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have .
the solution , as i see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
what is a fair society ?
mr president , commissioner , as my time is limited , i shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union .
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
in reunion , for example , the rate is 37 % .
it only remains to put this principle into practice .
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission .
so much for the quality .
regarding this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly .
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably .
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
i agree with your analysis .
fourthly , a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now , the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people .
i should like to mention a few specific points .
mr berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .
well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .
you may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 2 .
mr berend , you also mentioned , as did mr aparicio s찼nchez , the lack of reform in the fisheries sector .
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries , under commissioner fischler .
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .
this is my first point regarding the policy .
thank you very much , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m. )
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
are there any comments ?
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group .
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission .
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation .
it should not be dramatised into something more than that .
thank you very much , mr cox .
i understand what you are saying .
we have taken note of this .
however , it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda .
mr wynn , that makes sense .
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .
mrs ahern , we have taken note of this .
we will also pass this on to our services , however .
thank you very much .
( the minutes were approved )
reform of european competition policy
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
mr president , commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union ' s competition policy .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper .
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .
it should continue along this path .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
i do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question .
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .
therefore , i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone can not achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
i think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be assimilated in some way into state aid .
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
the commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the member states .
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .
as you know , commissioner , our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
there were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the commission submitted its own report on these .
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
according to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .
exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
under article 88 , the commission is obliged to supervise state aid .
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling eur 540 million to the preussag in germany .
furthermore , the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 december 1996 .
in addition , there is a special provision of up to eur 50 million for greece .
no one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in europe .
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike .
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .
a successive phasing out of state aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition .
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living .
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market is the basis for our work .
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled .
the eu ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .
in order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the member states ' national authorities .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed .
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
all this is to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union .
i would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and g체tesiegel .
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention .
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
these days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .
thank you very much , mr radwan .
while , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human interchange , it has never been perfect .
the market favours the short term and immediate profits .
in order to function , the market needs rules .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the main objective of the union ' s competition policy can not be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
the internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the american army .
the german government ' s intervention to save the holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
i did not hear mr duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund , ltcm .
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .
we socialists reject the liberals ' na챦ve optimism on this point .
we want a true culture of competition in europe .
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge .
mr president , commissioner , i want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
you have shown us the way , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard .
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
but , as i have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
mr president , commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
mr president , once again we are debating the european union ' s competition policy .
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
should we not be discussing this issue ?
they have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .
when will we debate that ?
at the same time , unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
in principle , only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition .
the rapporteur ' s amendments nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit .
market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
if this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
the commission ' s white paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
does the pressure of work within the commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the commission ?
what is the council ' s opinion on this and is the commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points ?
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views .
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .
in general , i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
it is true , there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
the commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .
they are still in training , as it were .
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regarding the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the white paper .
since the treaty entered into force , community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy .
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion .
for this reason , modernisation was essential .
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
i have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81(1 ) and 82 for some time .
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 1762 .
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape .
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
frankly , i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
various arguments have been presented in its favour .
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .
this is why i give this report my full support .
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe .
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission 's proposals .
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .
we look to him as the man to root out cartels .
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs , mr von wogau .
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
i know that the commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .
well , we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment .
so , judicially , something needs to be done .
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .
it is important that business has legal certainty .
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently .
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom .
we all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change .
we have been told how , currently , people 's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
but i really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
finally , we , as british conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that .
mr president , the european union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began .
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
society is surrendering itself to the economy .
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .
in common with the other members , i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement .
a word on the white paper : the revision of articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
the problem of overwork highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty .
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
but a system can not function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
but these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe .
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
no other member state is at such a disadvantage .
mr president , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe .
but opinion differs as to the solution .
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
we would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something i consider to be unacceptable .
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
this is unacceptable to my mind .
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
this is unacceptable in my view .
it would weaken a key element of european policy .
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
there was no majority for this at the time .
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
i consider this to be unacceptable .
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
the commission suggests shorter deadlines .
i agree with this request .
in the interests of equality , either the code must be applied or it must be modified .
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .
mr president , i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
i am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
the commission report confirms that , with the exception of germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
not to save jobs .
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
did these firms need state aid to survive ?
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .
mr president , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
the form the aid takes is important .
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr von wogau , for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts .
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
in his report , karl von wogau manages to capture this very well .
but europe is changing .
the european commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
this is not in question .
having said this , i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .
in the netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
this country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
this in contrast to germany , where a very experienced kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .
uniformity needs to be worked on .
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
what is the commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
it can not be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
but we all want to be oarsmen on it . we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed .
secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .
it is true , commissioner , that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
we all agree on this .
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said .
there have only been nine rejections .
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen can not be improved upon .
here improvements should be made .
only in certain countries , germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
commissioner , it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bears this out .
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups .
i will take these very quickly one at a time .
efficiency : i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , mrs peijs .
the purpose of publishing the white paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance .
this was raised by mrs thyssen , mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of smes .
many speakers have underlined this .
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .
is this simply a political gesture ?
most smes have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
the fourth group is legal certainty .
( fr ) mrs thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
i will mention only two , in order to be brief . the first is greater transparency .
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important .
in april 1999 , the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .
i am especially grateful for all of this .
in this regard , i liked your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
thank you , commissioner monti .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
protection under criminal law of the union 's financial interests
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
so far , efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures .
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 member states .
after five years only four have done so .
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being 30 september in a proposed amendment .
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states .
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
the commission , mr barnier , mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea .
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , is a critical report .
it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is .
we need to do something about it .
we need to take this responsibility seriously .
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .
the question is : who prosecutes ?
that is where we really get into difficulty .
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states .
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions .
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio .
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report .
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
this , i thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
i would like to make one general point on politics .
whatever we may say about the european elections , the low turnout is a fact .
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly , and this must be done at european level .
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .
mrs theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions .
yet , every year we have the same problem .
the court of auditors publishes its report , which criticises the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
having said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato ' s report receives more support .
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .
it is fine , in principle .
mr president , mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
and indeed there is a twofold shift .
basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe ' s citizens .
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving eu funds ?
i do not believe so .
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .
in the way it is structured , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes .
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement .
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office .
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
mr president , we all want to do something about combating european fraud .
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .
the tampere summit was about combating crime .
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
so a great deal has to be done in this area .
and what exactly should be done ?
two things , and mrs theato ' s report clearly spells these out .
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union .
so , unification in this small area .
the european public prosecutor ' s office is nothing to be afraid of . i feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .
it is , in fact , something very positive . just like europol .
parliament supports this . the committee of wise men supports this .
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same .
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget .
we need a public debate on this .
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed .
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed .
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate .
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .
sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but i digress .
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato ' s report .
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 .
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .
nothing has changed there .
as far as that is concerned , i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
mr president , for years , parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .
finally , following on from what was agreed in tampere , the report restates the need for a european public prosecutor .
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
mr president , the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged .
to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few member states .
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten ' s report .
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions .
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
as such , i would ask you to give olaf ' s work your full support , also in its present form .
thank you , commissioner schreyer .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it .
mr president , i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
i know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
i hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .
( parliament approved the commission proposal )
( parliament approved the commission proposal )

mr president , as far as the second reading is concerned , the commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by parliament .
the commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it .

explanations of vote- own resources
( fr ) the european union is apparently financed through four own resources .
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
furthermore , the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying member states .
there is as yet no federal european tax .
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .
directive 96/35/ec was a response to this requirement .
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .
parliament voted in favour of this text .
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then .
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 january 1999 .
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
until then , there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations .
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report , i have this important reservation .
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments can not alone decide on specific spending priorities .
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland .
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes .
they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .
( fr ) this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
mrs schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid .
amended again as such by the schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .
in the meantime , let us support this first step .
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .
member states can not be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling .
the truth is though , that the commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
a considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time .
in general , the current guidelines can not be considered as clear or transparent .
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the esf and employment strategy .
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the european works council , in existence since 1996 .
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened .
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states .
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union .
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .
is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament ?
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
the members of parliament from the lutte ouvri챔re party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy .
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power .
this is repulsive most of all in social terms .
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the european commission .
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german l채nder .
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid .
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .

oil slick off the french coast
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline , and why ?
if , i repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
well , if the charterer is exonerated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations .
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission .
what are the conditions for this recognition ?
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?
we await the outcome with great interest .
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up .
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries .
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
if the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team .
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively .
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods .
just as the sea empress , just as the braer did .
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
the time for resolutions has passed .
what is now needed is action .
mr president , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of europe .
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many .
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil .
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
in addition , it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
i can testify to this remarkable work .
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
this is no longer tolerable .
next , we have flags of convenience .
this is no longer tolerable .
finally , there is the lack of transparency .
this is no longer tolerable .
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
this is an approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo .
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .
this must be brought forward .
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future .
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
